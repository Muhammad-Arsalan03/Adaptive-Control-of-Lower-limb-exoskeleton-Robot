# Adaptive-Control-of-Lower-limb-exoskeleton-Robot
Developed an adaptive (Robust and passivity based ) controller for the lower limb exoskeleton device/ walk assist device to provide rehabilitation to the stroke effected patients.

Two control techniques are implemented on orthotic device (Robust control, and passivity based adaptive control).
"orthosis_trajectory.m" is the gait trajectory of actual human.
"orthosis_robust.slx" is the main SIMULINK file for robout control of 2DOF lower limb robot
"prosthesis_passivity_adaptive.slx" is the main SIMULINK file for robout control of 2DOF lower limb robot.
